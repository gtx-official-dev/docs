## How GTX Yield Works

### ðŸ”„ **Active Trading Yield**

Every limit order and trading position generates yield automatically:

    A[Place Limit Order] --> B[Order Enters Book]
    B --> C[Yield Accumulation Starts]
    C --> D[Position Compounds]
    D --> E[Order Fills + Yield Earned]
```

#### Yield Sources for Traders
- **Base Yield Rate** - Variable APY on order value
- **Position Yield** - Returns on held positions  
- **Order Book Participation** - Rewards for providing liquidity
- **Fee Rebates** - Portion of trading fees returned

## Yield Rates & Performance

### Current Yield Opportunities

| Activity | Base APY | GTX Rewards | Total Return* |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|

</Note>

### Yield Calculation Examples

#### Example 1: Day Trader
```javascript
// Active trader with frequent limit orders
Profile: 
- Daily trading volume: $10,000
- Average position time: 4 hours
- Order type: 70% limit orders

Daily Yield Calculation:
- Base yield: $10,000 Ã— 6% APY Ã— (4/24) hours = $1.00
- Trading rewards: 0.01% of volume = $1.00  
- Maker rebates: 30% of fees = $3.00

Total Daily Yield: ~$5.00
Annual Yield: ~$1,825 (18.25% on $10k average)
```

#### Example 2: Position Holder
```javascript
// Long-term holder with strategic positions
Profile:
- Position size: $50,000
- Hold duration: 30 days average
- Strategy: Buy and hold with yield

Monthly Yield Calculation:
- Base yield: $50,000 Ã— 4% APY Ã— (30/365) days = $164.38
- GTX rewards: Position value Ã— 0.1% = $50.00
- Compound effect: Previous yields earn additional yield

Total Monthly Yield: ~$214.38
Annual Yield: ~$2,572 (5.14% on $50k)
```

## Maximizing Your Yields

### Strategy 1: Optimize Order Types

<Steps>
  <Step title="Favor Limit Orders">
    Use limit orders over market orders to earn yield while waiting for execution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Strategic Pricing">
    Price orders competitively but with enough buffer for yield accumulation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Longer Time Horizons">
    Let orders sit longer to maximize yield before fills
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diversify Positions">
    Spread orders across multiple price levels and timeframes
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Strategy 2: Market Making

```javascript
// Optimal market making setup
const strategy = {
  spread: 0.2, // 0.2% spread around mid price
  orderSize: 1000, // $1000 per order
  levels: 5, // 5 levels on each side
  refreshRate: 300 // Update every 5 minutes
};

// Expected yields:
// - Base yield on $10,000 total orders
// - 2x GTX multiplier for market making
// - Fee rebates on successful fills
// - Spread profit when both sides fill
```

### Strategy 3: Cross-Chain Opportunities

Take advantage of cross-chain yield differentials:

- **Deposit on high-yield chains** - Some networks offer higher base rates
- **Bridge during peak periods** - Enhanced rewards during high activity
- **Utilize yield farming** - Combine trading with DeFi protocols

## GTX Token Economics

### Token Utility

GTX tokens provide multiple benefits within the ecosystem:

<CardGroup cols={3}>

    title="Fee Discounts"
    icon="percent"
  >
    Stake GTX to reduce trading fees up to 25%
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Yield Boosters"

## Yield Tracking & Analytics

### Real-Time Yield Dashboard

Monitor your earnings through the GTX DEX interface:

```javascript
// Access yield analytics
const yieldStats = await gtx.getUserYieldStats(userAddress);

console.log("Current yield rate:", yieldStats.currentAPY);
console.log("Total earned this month:", yieldStats.monthlyEarnings);
console.log("GTX rewards pending:", yieldStats.pendingGTX);
console.log("Fee rebates earned:", yieldStats.rebatesEarned);
```

### Yield Optimization Tools

#### Yield Calculator
```javascript
function calculateProjectedYield(params) {
  const { 
    positionSize, 
    timeFrame, 
    activityLevel, 
    gtxStaked 
  } = params;
  
  // Base rates vary by activity
  const baseRates = {
    high: 0.08,    // 8% for active traders
    medium: 0.05,  // 5% for regular users  
    low: 0.03      // 3% for holders
  };
  
  const baseRate = baseRates[activityLevel];
  const gtxMultiplier = calculateGTXBoost(gtxStaked);
  
  const annualYield = positionSize * baseRate * gtxMultiplier;
  const periodYield = annualYield * (timeFrame / 365);
  
  return {
    annualYield,
    periodYield,
    effectiveAPY: baseRate * gtxMultiplier * 100
  };
}
```

#### Performance Tracking
```javascript
// Track yield performance over time
const yieldHistory = await gtx.getYieldHistory(userAddress, '30d');

const analysis = {
  totalEarned: yieldHistory.reduce((sum, day) => sum + day.yield, 0),
  averageDaily: yieldHistory.length > 0 ? 
    totalEarned / yieldHistory.length : 0,
  bestDay: Math.max(...yieldHistory.map(d => d.yield)),
  consistency: calculateConsistencyScore(yieldHistory)
};
```

## Advanced Yield Strategies

### Compound Yield Strategy

```javascript
// Automatically reinvest yields for compounding
const compoundStrategy = {
  // Reinvest yields when they reach threshold
  reinvestThreshold: 100, // $100
  
  // Compound frequency
  frequency: 'weekly',
  
  // Reinvestment allocation
  allocation: {
    trading: 0.7,    // 70% back to trading
    staking: 0.2,    // 20% to GTX staking  
    reserves: 0.1    // 10% kept as reserves
  }
};
```
